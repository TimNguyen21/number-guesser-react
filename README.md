## Project Description

Number Guesser is a game designed for two players who attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a predefined range set by the players themselves. The objective of the game is for the players to continue guessing numbers until one successfully guesses the correct winning number. Upon submitting a guess, players receive feedback indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or matches the winning number. By interpreting this feedback, players can refine their guesses and improve their chances of correctly guessing the winning number as they approach it.

## Project History

The concept of this game was initially developed using pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS during my time at the Turing School of Software and Design, in collaboration with a coding partner.

Link to the previous project repository: [Number Guesser (Vanilla Javascript)](https://github.com/TimNguyen21/Number-Guesser)

The objective of this new repository is to showcase the process of migrating the game's development to a more modern coding structure, utilizing React.js. By undertaking this migration, I aim to demonstrate how the same application can be created using different technologies and coding practices.
